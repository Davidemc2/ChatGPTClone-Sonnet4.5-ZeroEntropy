### 4. Memory Search Test
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/memory/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "test", "n_results": 5}'
```
Expected: JSON with `results` array

### 5. Session List Test
```bash

- [ ] RAG retrieval: < 100ms
- [ ] Memory search: < 200ms
- [ ] Session list: < 50ms
- [ ] UI loads: < 2 seconds

### Resource Usage
Check system resources:

- [ ] Backend RAM usage: < 1GB baseline
- [ ] Frontend RAM usage: Normal for browser
- [ ] CPU usage: Reasonable during inference
- [ ] Disk space: ChromaDB grows with data

---

## ✅ Error Handling Verification

### Test Error Scenarios

1. **Invalid API Key**
   - [ ] Set wrong API key
   - [ ] Get clear error message
   - [ ] System doesn't crash

2. **Network Issues**
   - [ ] Disconnect from internet
   - [ ] Get connection error
   - [ ] Can retry after reconnection

3. **Invalid Input**
   - [ ] Send empty message
   - [ ] Send extremely long message
   - [ ] Proper validation or graceful handling

4. **Missing Dependencies**
   - [ ] Backend fails gracefully if dependencies missing
   - [ ] Clear error messages guide resolution

---

## ✅ Integration Verification

### Data Persistence
- [ ] Sessions survive backend restart
- [ ] Memory survives backend restart
- [ ] ChromaDB data persists
- [ ] No data loss on normal shutdown

### Cross-Component Communication
- [ ] Frontend → Backend API works
- [ ] Backend → OpenAI API works
- [ ] Backend → ChromaDB works
- [ ] All components communicate correctly

---

## ✅ Documentation Verification

- [ ] README.md renders correctly
- [ ] SETUP.md instructions are clear
- [ ] ARCHITECTURE.md is comprehensive
- [ ] EXAMPLES.md code works as shown
- [ ] API docs accessible at /docs endpoint
- [ ] All links in docs work

---

## ✅ Security Verification

- [ ] `.env` file in `.gitignore`
- [ ] No secrets committed to git
- [ ] CORS configured appropriately
- [ ] API validates all inputs
- [ ] No sensitive data in logs
- [ ] Session isolation works

---

## ✅ Production Readiness (Optional)

For production deployment:

- [ ] HTTPS enabled
- [ ] Rate limiting configured
- [ ] Monitoring setup
- [ ] Backup strategy defined
- [ ] Error tracking configured
- [ ] Load testing completed
- [ ] Security audit done

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

If any check fails, refer to:

1. **SETUP.md** - Installation issues
2. **README.md** - General guidance
3. **QUICK_REFERENCE.md** - Common commands
4. **Backend logs** - API issues
5. **Browser console** - Frontend issues
6. **Docker logs** - Container issues

Common Issues:
- Missing API key → Add to `.env`
- Port conflicts → Change ports in config
- Memory issues → Reduce context size
- Slow responses → Use faster model
